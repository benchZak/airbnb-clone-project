### 💡 Importance of Identifying Design Properties in a Mockup

Understanding the design properties (such as colors, typography, spacing, and component styles) in a Figma mockup is essential because:

- 🎨 **Consistency**: Ensures all UI elements maintain a unified look and feel throughout the app.
- 🧱 **Reusability**: Helps in building reusable and modular UI components.
- ⚙️ **Developer Efficiency**: Provides clear design rules for implementation, reducing guesswork and development time.
- 📱 **Responsive Design**: Allows designers and developers to anticipate how components scale and behave across devices.
- ♿ **Accessibility**: Helps ensure visual elements like color contrast and text sizing meet accessibility standards.
- 🔄 **Design-Dev Sync**: Maintains alignment between designers and developers, avoiding misunderstandings.

Mockups are not just static visuals—they are the blueprint for building intuitive and visually appealing digital experiences.
